## Chapter 11 - Markov Chains


Smith is in jail and has 1 dollar; he can get out on bail if he has 8 dollars.A guard agrees to make a series of bets with him. If Smith bets A dollars,he wins A dollars with probability .4 and loses A dollars with probability .6.Find the probability that he wins 8 dollars before losing all of his money if

(a) he bets 1 dollar each time (timid strategy).

(b) he bets, each time, as much as possible but not more than necessary to bring his fortune up to 8 dollars (bold strategy).

(c) Which strategy gives Smith the better chance of getting out of jail?


## Timid Strategy
If we use timid play, then this means Smith’s fortune is a Markov chain
(Xn, n = 0, 1, . . .) which is representing the evolution of Smith’s money


![Q1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnm1990/data605/main/assignment10_1.png)

```{r}
w <- 0.4
x <- 1-w
y <- 1
z <- 8
Prob_timid <- round((1 - (x/w)^y) / ( 1 - (x/w)^z),4)

print(Prob_timid)
```
We see about little over a 2% chance Smith will win these bets, with this strategy.

If we use simulation to calculate this one
```{r}
a = 0.4
b = 0.6
c = b/a

for (i in seq(1, 7 , 1)){
  print ((1-c^i)/(1-c^8))
}

```

## Bold Strategy
![Q2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnm1990/data605/main/assignment10_2.PNG)
Smiths fortune is a Markov chain with transition matrix P
Absorption matrix
```{r}
dbinom(3,3,0.4) 
```

```{r}
m <- matrix(c(1,0,0,0,0,0.6,0,0.4,0,0,0.6,0,0,0.4,0,0.6,0,0,0,0.4,0,0,0,0,1), ncol=5,nrow=5, byrow = TRUE)
m

f <- matrix(c(0,1,0,0,0), ncol=5,nrow = 1,byrow = TRUE)
f

u <- f%*%m
u

c <- u%*%m
c

k <- c%*%m
k

b <- k%*%m
b
```

Since the Smith bets A dollars and will lose or gain A dollars, and Smith bets his entire money each time until $8. Smith must win each time or lose. If Smith wins sequence is: 1,2,4,8. He starts with 1 dollar and must win 3 bets in a row at p=0.4 p=0.4
Smith probability of winning $8 with bold strategy is 0.064


## Conclusion
Bold Strategy would be the best. It gives Smith a better chance to get out of jail.
