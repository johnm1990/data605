## Question #2
Biologists are treating a pond contaminated with bacteria.  The level of contamination is changing at a rate of dNdt = 3150t4 220 bacteria per cubic centimeter per day, where t is the number of days since treatment began.  Find a function N(t) to estimate the level of contamination if the level after 1 day was 6530 bacteria per cubic centimeter.

## Question #3
Find the total area of the red rectangles in the figure below, where the equation of the line is  f (x) = 2x-9

```{r}
Area <- function(x) {2*(x)-9}
integrate(Area, lower = 4.5, upper = 8.5)
```

## Question #4
Find the area of the region bounded by the graphs of the given equations.y = x2-2x-2,  y = x + 2. Enter your answer below

```{r}
curve(x^2 -2*x-2, lwd = 2, xlim=c(-5, 5))
curve(x+2, lwd = 2, xlim=c(-5, 5), add = TRUE)

```

```{r}
#Find area in-build function
f1 = function(x) {x + 2}
f2 = function(x) {x^2 -2*x -2}

#Find the difference between areas under the curve
area1 <- integrate(f1, -1, 4)
area2 <- integrate(f2, -1, 4)
area <- round((area1$value - area2$value),4)
print(area)
```

## Question #5
A beauty supply store expects to sell 110 flat irons during the next year.  It costs $3.75 to store one flat iron for one year.  There is a fixed cost of $8.25 for each order.  Find the lot size and the number of orders per year that will minimize inventory costs.

The store will need to order 22 units 5 times through out the year to achieve 110 sales at the minimal inventory cost.

## Question #6
Use integration by parts to solve the integral below.

## Question #7
Determine whether f (x) is a probability density function on the interval 1, e6.  If not, determine the value of the definite integral.
