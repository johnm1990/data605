## Question #1
Find the equation of the regression line for the given points.  Round any final values to the nearest hundredth, if necessary.( 5.6, 8.8 ), ( 6.3, 12.4 ), ( 7, 14.8 ), ( 7.7, 18.2 ), ( 8.4, 20.8 )

```{r}
x <- c(5.6, 6.3, 7, 7.7, 8.4 )
y <- c(8.8, 12.4, 14.8, 18.2, 20.8)
df <- data.frame(cbind(x, y))

xy.lm <- lm(y ~ x, data = df)
xy.lm
```

```{r}
plot(df$x, df$y)
abline(xy.lm, col="green")
```

## y=−14.80+4.26x

## Question #2
Find all local maxima, local minima, and saddle points for the function given below.  Write your answer(s) in the form (x, y, z).  Separate multiple points with a comma.f (x, y) = 24x 6xy2 8y3
```
1. Start by finding the first derivative of the function with respect to x (fx) and y (fy) -
fx = 24 - 6y2
fy = 12xy - 24y2
2. Find the crtical points (may be a minimum, maximum or saddle point) for fx and fx -
solving for y
0 = 24 - 6y2
y = sqrt(24/6)
y = +/- 2
solving for x where y = 2
0 = -12(2)x - 24(2)2
0 = -24x - 96
x = 96/-24 = -4
solving for x where y = -2
0 = -12(-2)x - 24(-2)2
0 = 24x - 96
x = 96/24 = 4
Critical points for this function are (2,-4) and (-2,4)
3. Find the possible concativitity of the crtical points by solving for the second derivative fxx and fxx as well as mixed derivative fxy -
fxx = 0 (no info provided about concativity, possible saddle point)
fyy = -12x - 48y
for critical point (2,-4)
0 = -12(2) - 48(-4) = + (upward concativity - possible minimum)
for critical point (-2-,4)
0 = -12(-2) - 48(4) = - (downward concativity - possible maximum)
fxy = -12y
for critical point (2,-4)
fxy = -12(-4) = 48
for critical point (2,4)
fxy = -12(4) = -48
4. Perform the second partial derivative test to determine the maximum (H>0), minimum (H also > 0) and saddle point (H < 0)
H = fxx * fyy - (fxy)2
for critical point (2,-4)
0 * fyy - (48)2
= - (negative) at (2,-4) conclusion: saddle point
for critical point (-2,-4)
0 * fyy - (-48)2
= (negative) at (-2,4) conclusion: saddle point
```

## Question #3
A grocery store sells two brands of a product, the "house" brand and a "name" brand.  The manager estimates that if she sells the "house" brand for x dollars and the "name" brand for y dollars, she will be able to sell 81  21x + 17y units of the "house" brand and 40 + 11x 23y units of the "name" brand.3. 

### Step 1. Find the revenue function R (x, y)

```
To find pending revenue we multiply the amount of units to sell times the dollar amount.

Therefore the revenue function is like so:

x(81−21x+17y)+y(40+11x−23y)

Simplfied we get:

−21x2−23y2+28xy+81x+40y
```

### Step 2. What is the revenue if she sells the "house" brand for $2.30 and the "name" brand for $4.10?
```
##Step 1. Find the revenue function R(x,y)

Revenue = (Units Sold) x (Sales Price)
R(x,y)=(x∗(81−21x+17y))+(y∗(40+11x−23y))
R(x,y)=81x−21x2+17xy+40y+11xy−23y2
R(x,y)=−21x2−23y2+81x+40y+28xy

```


```{r}
 ##Step 2. What is the revenue if she sells the “house” brand for $2.30 and the “name” brand for $4.10?
  
  revenue <- function(x, y) {
  return(-21*(x^2) - 23*(y^2) + 81*x + 40*y + 28*x*y)
}

revenue(2.30, 4.10)

```

## The revenue is: $116.62

## Question #4
A company has a plant in Los Angeles and a plant in Denver.  The firm is committed to produce a total of 96 units of a product each week.  The total weekly cost is given by C(x, y) = 16x2 + 16y2 + 7x + 25y + 700,  where x is the number of units produced in Los Angeles and y is the number of units produced in Denver.  How many units should be produced in each plant to minimize the total weekly cost?

```
x+y=96=total units to produce each weeky=96−x

Given y=96−x
we can substitute 96−x

every place we see y in or original function and turn this into a univariate problem.

C(x,y)C1(x)=16x2+16y2+7x+25y+700=16x2+16(96−x)2+7x+25(96−x)+700=16x2+1536−32x+16x2+7x+2400−25x+700=13x2−50x+4636

Find the derivative of C1(x)

C′1(x)=23x−50

Find the critical points:

C′1(x)=23x−5023xx=0=50=75

Since y=96−x
, when x=75, then y=21.

```
## We see that the company needs to produce 75 units in LA and 21 units in Denver each week in order to meet their production commitment and minimize costs.
