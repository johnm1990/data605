#1  Chebyshev's inequality:

P(|X – mu| >= k*s) <= 1/k^2

Only the case k > 1 is useful. When k <= 1 the right-hand side 1/k^2 >=1 and the inequality is trivial as all probabilities are ≤ 1.


mu = 10
s^2 = 100/3
Let co = k*s => k = co/s


```{r}

mu = 10
s = sqrt(100/3)
co = c(2,5,9,20)
k = co/s
k
upper_bound = ifelse (k > 1, 1/k^2, 1)

## 10 The minimum of exponential random variables X1, ,,, Xn each of which has mean μ. Show that Y = min(X1, ,,, Xn) distributed exponentially with mean μ/n

Exponential: X ~ Exp(m) = e^(-mx) where m = the decay parameter

mean μ = 1/m => m = 1/μ


## 11 Company buys 100 lightbulbs each of which has an exponential lifetime 1000 hours. What is expected lifetime for the first of this to burn out?

μ = 1000 hours
With n = 100 μ/n = 10 hours


## 14. X1 and X2 independent exponentially distributed random variables with parameter m. Show that Z = X1 - X2 has density 

...
Theorem: The distribution of the difference of two independent exponential random variables, with population meansα1andα2respectively, has a Laplace distribution with param-etersα1andα2.
